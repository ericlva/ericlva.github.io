===============
Stephen Robertson,
http://research.microsoft.com/users/robertson/

Stephen Robertson joined Microsoft Research Cambridge in April 1998.

In 1998, he was awarded the Tony Kent STRIX award by the Institute of
Information Scientists. In 2000, he was awarded the Salton Award by ACM SIGIR.
He is a Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge.

At Microsoft, he runs a group called Information Retrieval and Analysis, which
is concerned with core search processes such as term weighting, document
scoring and ranking algorithms, and combination of evidence from different
sources. These are studied theoretically through the use of formal models,
mainly statistical, and statistical methods including machine learning
methods, and experimentally, through activities such as the Text Retrieval
Conference (TREC) and with internally generated evaluation sets. The group
(with its Keenbow evaluation environment) has had some excellent results at
TREC. The group works closely with product groups to transfer ideas and
techniques.

His main research interests are in the design and evaluation of retrieval
systems. He is the author, jointly with Karen Sparck Jones, of a probabilistic
theory of information retrieval, which has been moderately influential. A
further development of that model, with Stephen Walker, led to the term
weighting and document ranking function known as Okapi BM25, which is used in
many experimental text retrieval systems.

Prior to joining Microsoft, he was at City University London, where he retains
a part-time position as Professor of Information Systems in the Department of
Information Science (homepage). He was Head of Department for eight years,
during which time it achieved the highest possible rating in two successive
research assessment exercises. He also started the Centre for Interactive
Systems Research, the main research vehicle of which is the Okapi text
retrieval system, which has also done well at TREC.

Before joining City, he was a research fellow at University College London,
where he took his PhD in the School of Library Archive and Information
Studies. Before that he was in the research department at Aslib. He has an MSc
in Information Science from City and a first degree in mathematics from
Cambridge.

Nick Craswell
http://research.microsoft.com/~nickcr

I am an associate researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge, in the
Information Retrieval and Analysis Group.

Research Overview

I am interested in Web search evaluation, mostly on enterprise-scale webs but
also the World Wide Web. I built the VLC, VLC2, WT2g and .GOV test
collections, which have been made available to research groups around the
world. David Hawking and I coordinated the TREC Web Track experiments. I am
currently involved in the TREC Terabyte Track and Enterprise Track. Some
publications: Book chapter preprint (pdf), IR'01 (citeseer) and CSIRO'01
(pdf).

I also work on effective Web search, which means making use of information in
pages, link structure and URL structure to generate more useful Web search
results. Some papers: SIGIR'05 (pdf), SIGIR'01 (pdf), TOIS'03 (pdf) (copying
is by permission of ACM, Inc.) and ADCS'03 (pdf).

My PhD was in distributed information retrieval (thesis pdf) which means
building a system on top of multiple engines/databases that already exist. My
recent work in the area has considered whether (or when) DIR is really
practical. Some papers: ADC'99 (ps), DL'00 (pdf), ADC'03 (pdf) and ADC'04
(pdf).

===============
Web Search & Data Mining Group of MSR Asia
http://research.microsoft.com/wsm/

The goal of the Web Search & Data Mining Group of MSR Asia is to drive the
next generation of Web search by leveraging data mining, machine learning, and
knowledge discovery techniques for information analysis, organization,
retrieval, and visualization. In addition, in contrast with current Web search
methods, which essentially do document-level ranking and retrieval, the Web
Search & Data Mining Group has created search at the object level to bring
increased knowledge and intelligence to users.

A Glimpse at Several Core Innovations:

Large-scale Experimental Web Search Platform

The Web Search & Data Mining Group is creating a large scale search platform
to efficiently store, parse, index and search billions of Web pages and other
types of documents. The search platform is flexible enough to allow for
testing of various state-of-the-art search techniques that have been created
at the lab using new technologies.

Structuralizing the Web

The biggest challenge facing both users and search engines over the next
several decades is the continued unstructured growth of the Internet. As such,
search functions that can effectively and efficiently dig out
machine-understandable information and knowledge layers from unorganized and
unstructured Web data will be the key to supporting relevant search results.
To meet this challenge, the group is exploring technologies, namely Web
information extraction, deep Web mining, and Web structure mining that can
automatically classify structures and extract objects from the Web. The
information and knowledge gathered using these new techniques greatly improves
the performance of current Web search and even facilitates the creation of
more sophisticated next generation search technologies.

Vertical Search

Today's conventional search engines can be described as page-level search
engines whose main function is to rank web pages according to their relevance
to a given query. Driving the future of the search industry are functions that
delve deeper into vertical domains to provide knowledge and intelligence to
query results. At MSR Asia, the Web Search & Data Mining Group is addressing
the greatest challenges faced by vertical search including large scale web
classification, object-level information extraction, object identification and
integration, and object relationship mining and ranking. The results of these
efforts are leading to more advanced search engines that deliver intelligence
and insight to search results.

Mobile Search

The explosive growth of new computing devices such as handheld computers,
Windows Mobile-based PocketPCs, and SmartPhones is driving demand for greater
and more efficient information access. These devices, which leverage the power
of the Web and allow greater access to information than ever before, are still
not capable of performing at the level of a desktop PC. At MSR Asia, the Web
Search & Data Mining Group is inventing new technologies to improve the mobile
search and browsing experience and deliver the capabilities of a PC to users
of these new devices. Project initiatives include developing innovative
presentation schemes and user interfaces to facilitate search and browsing
tasks on mobile devices and developing context aware search technologies to
address the special information needs of mobile users.

Multimedia Search

The Web Search & Data Mining Group is conducting research into new
technologies that index multimedia content such as images, videos, and audio.
Through content analysis and advanced visualization techniques, the group is
transforming today's conventional text based search engines to include
multimedia content thus delivering more intelligent search results to users.
For example, the group recently developed a new multimedia news reader which
mines large archival news databases presenting text, map information, images,
and background music within a unique user interface providing readers with a
more efficient news search engine and a more enjoyable reading experience.
